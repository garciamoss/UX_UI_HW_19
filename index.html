The timeline was five weeks. Currently, the site is an impersonal, bloated labyrinth of broken links and disorientating navigation; my solution was to pare down the site navigation, using the <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/K2jq8Eh9mm1a2NwwlliEfE/DepartmentOfLabor_LMoss?node-id=776%3A10271&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=278%3A3004&starting-point-node-id=776%3A10271&show-proto-sidebar=1" target="_blank">mobile-first</a> approach and re-establishing the agency’s focus on the American wage-earner.

                    <p>A friend recommended Twinings Tea as the focus for my food packaging/branding assignment; it's a dominant brand in her native England but not well-known here in the States, though widely available in grocery chains such as Kroger and Publix. My approach is to give Twinings, a 300-year-old brand, a quintessentially English High-Tea profile.</p>

                    <p>I read Pearl S. Buck’s <em>The Good Earth</em> in high school, but I wasn’t aware it was part of a trilogy. The cover assignment allowed me to correct this oversight. I wanted to simulate the bamboo scroll paintings I saw at a museum exhibition. However, because the trilogy chronicles China's transformation into a significant 20th century world power, I may revisit the assignment.</p>

Azzurra’s brand identity started with a logo, then expanded to airline tickets, baggage labels, brochures, and a jet prototype. This is another project worthy of a revisit, this time to apply UX/UI practices.</p>
